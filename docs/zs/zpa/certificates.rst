certificates
-----------------

The following methods allow for interaction with the ZPA
Browser Access Certificate API endpoints.

Methods are accessible via ``zpa.certificates``

Browser Access is the only ZPA API endpoint for certificates provided by Zscaler at the time of publishing. The
``zpa.certificates`` namespace has been chosen to accommodate any potential future certificate API endpoints.
